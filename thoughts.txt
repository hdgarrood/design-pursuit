introduction text
-----------------

Cabal has the long-form 'description' field as well as 'synopsis'; this is
potentially useful because it's not quite the same as the README; maybe we
could emulate it with an INTRODUCTION.md, for text that's displayed on the
package's front page?

Alternatively, let the README.md go on Pursuit, and let people make a separate
HACKING.md if they want to. (I like this better)
